                <div class="photowithcaption">
                <p>My name is Jenny O'Donnell. 
                </p>
                <p>I'm a second year student at the University of Florida with a major in public relations and a minor in nonprofit leadership and management. I'm hoping to combine my passions for in-depth storytelling, multimedia, and international mission work in my professional career. </p>
                <p>I've exlplored these areas of interest throughout my time in college. Whether traveling with international students, creating and maintaing my blogs, or helping unerprivaleged children, I always try to find inspiration through all my endeavors.</p>
               <p>My love of writing and storytelling formed when I was a child. I would make up stories in my head before I went to bed, and fervently right them down before I could forget anything (or before my parents came in and yelled at me for being awake).</p>
                <p>Now, this passion has evolved into something more. I used to think the best stories were ones made purely from imagination; now, I know that they are born from truth. People who you think may lead ordinary lives can have the most poignant stories behind them.</p>
               <p>On this website, you will find links and media that showcase my work and inspirations. I hope that you find as much inspiration behind these stories as I do.</p>
