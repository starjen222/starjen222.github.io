                <div class="padding">
                <p>Here are just a few samples of my work.</a> The colorful page is a sample from my high school yearbook, where I edited, took photos and created layouts.</p> 
                <p>The newspaper clippings are from my summer internship at <a href="http://www.ospreyobserver.com/">The Osprey Observer </a> when I was in high school. This internship was where I first got a taste of journalistic-style writing.</p> 
                <p>The first story I wrote was about a local woman who shared her story with me about the trials and great joys that came with adopting children from Russia, and how they have a reunion every two years. It was a heartwarming story and one of my first interviews I personally conducted for the internship.</p>
                <p>This was one of the more fun stories I was able to cover for <em>The Osprey Observer</em>. I interviewed a local student who went to my high schopl about the charity founded to help Big Cat Rescue, where abused and injured cats are rehabilitated. Although I still had much to learn about writing hard news, I worked to get as much interesting and relevant information as I could.</p>
                <p> The final article here that I wrote for <em>The Osprey Observer</em> was one of the more difficult. It involved heavy emotions for to the cause of fallen soldiers and their families. Many facts had to be collected   </p>
                
            <p>The final sample is a news release that was sent out to the media on behalf of an event for <a href="http://www.ulcgainesville.com/">University Lutheran Church.</a> This press release notified local media about the event and was actually published in <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20130908/ARTICLES/130909613/">The Gainesville Sun.</a></p>
                <p>More of my recent stories have been published in The Independent Florida Alligator. For the first article, I localized a national story about a more gender-inclusive law being passed in <a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/article_e99f0b90-7cd8-11e3-8ada-001a4bcf887a.html/">California schools.</a> The second was an event preview for the Ringling Bros. Circus coming to the UF campus <a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/article_a771eedc-78ea-11e3-9d18-001a4bcf887a.html">for the first time.</a></
